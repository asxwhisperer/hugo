Video games developer, [PlaySide Studios (ASX:PLY)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/PLY):

> has launch[ed] its third-party publishing division, PlaySide Publishing.

An interesting extension for the largest publicly listed games developer in Australia.

The division: 

> Enables playSide to facilitate and participate in the success of third-party titles and "incubate" a deeper portfolio of titles in the key PC and Console segment.

Who will run the division?

> Harley Homewood joins as Global Head of Publishing [ex-Team17]
> 
> Michael McAlister as Global Head of Marketing & Communications (ex-Bethesda Software & Rockstar Games)
> 
> Jordon Cameron in the role of Global Senior Communications Manager (ex-Activision Blizzard)
