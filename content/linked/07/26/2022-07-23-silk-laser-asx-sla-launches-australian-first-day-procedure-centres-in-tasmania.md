What does this mean? Not sure, but it sounds important:

> SILK Laser is the first operator in the state — and the country — to meet these new requirements and be awarded a licence, launching as a day procedure centre in a retail setting. 

Looks like Tasmania has been increasing regulatory requirements fro the booming injectables.

> The process to obtain this licence took 18 months, with SILK working side-by-side with Tasmanian Health.
