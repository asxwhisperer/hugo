The CPI print was below expectations of a 1.9% quarterly uplift according to a Reuters poll. It's the highest since 2001.

The trimmed mean CPI, the Reserve Bank of Australia's preferred inflation measure rose 4.9% on an annualised basis, exceeding exceptions of 4.7%, and rising 1.5% in the quarter vs 1.4% expectations. Its highest annual pace since the series began in 2003.
