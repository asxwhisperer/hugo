Additive manufacturing company, [AML3D (ASX:AL3)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/AL3):

> announce[d] that the Company has received a further additional purchase agreement to develop and produce 3D printed components for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)

Boeing sure [ain't the company it used to be](https://www.netflix.com/title/81272421).

> ... key components will involve extensive printing of high strength Aluminium ... aligned with the requirements of AS9100D quality assurance for "fly" parts.

For Boeing's sake, let's hope the 3D printed parts keep the planes in the [air](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings).
