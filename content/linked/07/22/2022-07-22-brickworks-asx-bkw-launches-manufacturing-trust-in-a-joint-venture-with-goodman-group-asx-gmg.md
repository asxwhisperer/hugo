Building products company, [Brickworks (ASX:BKW)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/BKW):

> announced the launch of the Brickworks Manufacturing Trust, a new Joint Venture manufacturing property trust with Goodman Group.

<!--more-->

This seems like a ripper deal for Brickworks. What are the details of the joint venture?

> Brickworks will retain 50.1% ownership of the new trust, with the remaining 49.9% interest sold to Goodman.

Brickworks and Goodman already have a joint venture property trust called, the Industrial Trust. Which houses third-party tenants such as, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Coles (ASX:COL), Woolworths (ASX:WOW) and Australia Post. 

The new trust will be:

> tenanted by Brickworks' operating businesses, such as Austral Bricks, Bristle Roofing, Austral Masonry and Austral Precast, with long duration leases of 5-20 years ...

How much will Goodman pay?

> $207 [million] 
> ...
> represent[ing] a $280 million premium to the book value of the assets ...

Brickworks will walk away with, $193 million in net cash proceeds, but only a $74 million uplift to net assets due to way accounting allows them to report the profit. 

Overall, a really great way to unlock value from Brickworks, while retaining control of their properties and re-positioning its existing assets and now income producing property assets. 

The accompanying [Investor Presentation](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02544420-2A1386506?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) has a great overview of their property portfolio. 

Share price has been smashed recently, with rising interest rates and energy prices. However, looks interesting as a long-term compounder.
