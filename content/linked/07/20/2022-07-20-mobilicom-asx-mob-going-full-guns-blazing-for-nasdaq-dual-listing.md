> planned NASDAQ dual listing is at an advanced stage.

I heard someone say the other week, that if you look at all dual-listed ASX companies, they've all failed. Especially those going to America. It was the combination of the being completely lost in the size of the US market, halving your liquidity, and split shareholder priority. 

> The NASDAQ dual listing plays a key role in Mobilicom's longer-term growth strategy.

They're definitely going full guns blazing.
