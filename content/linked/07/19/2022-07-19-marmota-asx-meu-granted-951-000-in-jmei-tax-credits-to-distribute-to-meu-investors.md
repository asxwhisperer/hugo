Mining exploration company, [Marmota (ASX:MEU)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/MEU):

> has been successful in its application to participate in the Federal Government's Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive (JMEI) program ...

<!--more-->

How much do they get?

> The Commissioner of Taxation has allocated $951,000 in JMEI tax credits ...

Today I learned the JMEI program [exists](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/junior-minerals-exploration-incentive/) — kind of like a specialist franking credit — worth $100 million over four years to 2025. 

> In the event that there is no tax liability to offset, then the tax credits are issued as a tax refund by the Tax Office.
