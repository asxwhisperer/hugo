Concussion management technology company, [HITIQ (ASX:HIQ)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/HIQ):

> has renewed its CSX Concussion Assessment agreement with the Australian Football League (AFL) [including] the Victorian Football League (VFL).

<!--more-->

The agreement covers the 2022 and 2023 seasons and will provide concussion assessment functionality to:

> 2000 players, comprising 18 AFL teams, 14 AFLW teams (increasing to 18 AFLW teams in 2023) and 21 VFL teams.

2000 players seemed high, but I get I never thought about it, and 2000 over 3 leagues actually seems reasonable.
