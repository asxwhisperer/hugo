Funds management company, [Magellan Financial Group (ASX:MFG)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/MFG):

> Magellan InReview 2022 [...] has been shared with shareholders and can be found on Magellan's website

Two Magellan posts in the same day. 

It has been a rough year for Magellan: down 71.51% on the year, losing major institutional fund mandates, losing the co-founder and CIO.

The 2022 InReview conveniently avoids these issues with the focus on insights relating to its global portfolio. 

> 'The world confronts an unusual number of difficulties' â€” the annual investor letter from Global Portfolio Managers Nikki Thomas and Arvid Streimann.

Good Sunday reading non-the-less.
