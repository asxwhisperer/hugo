Outdoor, lifestyle and sports company, [KMD Brands (ASX:KMD)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/KMD):

> advises that Reuben Casey has given notice of his resignation as Kathmandu brand CEO.

<!--more-->

Casey has been with Kathmandu for over 12 years:

> serving as CFO, COO prior to being appointed CEO.

Interestingly:

> Michael Daly will act as interim Kathmandu CEO while options for a replacement are assessed in the weeks ahead.

Has Casey left effective immediately? Strange.
