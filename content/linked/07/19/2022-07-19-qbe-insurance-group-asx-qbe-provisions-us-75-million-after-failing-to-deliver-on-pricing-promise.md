Insurance company, [QBE Insurance Group (ASX:QBE)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/QBE):

> has identified instances where the policy pricing promise was not fully delivered.

<!--more-->

Which is code for: "ripping off customers". The admission is as a result of ASIC's industry review.

> QBE will record a provision [...] of US$75 million before tax.

Which is A$109 million. Which makes me think why they decided to report in US dollars instead of AUD.

QBE Group CEO, Andrew Horton said: 

> We are disappointed by the findings of the review and apologise to those of our customers who have been impacted.

He was quick to point out that:

> QBE has been investigating pricing practices dating back several years, across a number of different policy administration systems and products.

Translation: "it's not my fault I swear".
