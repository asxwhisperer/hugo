Additive manufacturing technology company, [AML3D (ASX:AL3)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/AL3):

> announce[d] the successful Placement of shares to a range of Sophisticated Investors, raising $2.68 [million] (before costs)

What were the costs?

They don't tell us. But the shares were:

> issued at $0.0714 per share, being a 10% discount to the volume-weighted-average-price [over the] 14 days prior

Gotta love it when three-significant figures gets you to four-decimal places.

The company mentioned not just, once, not twice, but three times, that it has 'landmark' supply agreements with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) â€” someone is proud.
