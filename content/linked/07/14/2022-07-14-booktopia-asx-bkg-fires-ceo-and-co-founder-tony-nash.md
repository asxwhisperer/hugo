Online only book retailer, [Booktopia (ASX:BKG)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/BKG):

> has given Tony Nash notice to step down as CEO effective from close of business yesterday 13 July 2022.

Not a great way to start the conversation — let's find out more:

> The Company has just completed an internal business review focussed on, amongst other things, its overall strategy, efficiency and its cost structure.

Go on:

> As part of this process, the Board has determined that retaining Tony Nash as the Chief Growth Officer, whilst at the same time appointing a new CEO was not in the best interests of the business going forward.

Rough! But wait, what's this Chief Growth Officer business? I thought he was being fired as CEO? Turns out, he was already on his way out as CEO, all the way back in [May](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02517229-2A1371689?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) — stepping away from day-to-day operations and transitioning into a newly created role.

The brutality continues:

> Accordingly, the Board has given Tony notice to step away from executive management of the Company in order to enable a new CEO to enter with a fresh start [...]

Get this:

> [...] on well laid foundations.

The nicest thing they could say about the co-founder, who will continue to be a director and own 16.6% of the company.

So, who's running the show now?

> Geoff Stalley, the current CFO, has been appointed as the interim CEO until a new CEO is selected [...]
