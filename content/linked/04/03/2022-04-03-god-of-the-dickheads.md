Not an ASX Announcement, however, this story was in the AFR's Most Viewed for almost the entire week.

Joe Aston, writing for Rear Window at the [Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com):

> Welcome to Fitzyâ€™s Self-Awareness Free Zone. The guy wearing a pirate hankie on his head for no explicable reason, hectoring Sydney with his witless attitudes, naming the dickheads among us.
>
> There is no greater dickhead than Peter FitzSimons. Were there an All Australian team of dickheads, Fitzy would be its captain and its most capped player. His trophy cabinet would hold the Brownlow, the Coleman and the Norm Smith medals. Gary Ablett Sr would be supplanted as God ...  of the dickheads.

I do not normally give Joe Aston's vociferous platitudes much weight, and to be clear, I still don't. Nonetheless, this is the probably the funniest two paragraphs I've ever read in the AFR.

It feels like Joe has been waiting to write this for the last 9 years. 

Who hurt you?
