Private equity company, [Teaminvest Private Group (ASX:TIP)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/TIP):

> has entered the UK and European markets with the establishment of Teaminvest Private (UK) Limited

All well and good, but then comes the worst sentence I've read in an ASX announcement:

> ... meet the Company's noble purpose of *'Transferring Knowledge Between Generations'*.
