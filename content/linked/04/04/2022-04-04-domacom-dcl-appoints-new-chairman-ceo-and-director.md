Fractional investment platform, [DomaCom (ASX:DCL)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/DCL):

> Former Liberal Party Leader and experienced economist and company director, Dr John Hewson has been appointed DomaCom non-executive [Chair] and experienced financial services leader John Elkovich has been appointed Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect.
> 
> Ms Angela Williams also joins the board as an experienced marketer in the fintech space.
> 
> ... former Chief Executive Officer Arthur Naoumidis has left the company.

DomaCom embarrassingly remains suspended on the ASX since [11 May 2021](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02373522-3A566934?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4).

Makes you think â€” why has Arthur remained in his position this long?

Hopefully, a wholesale change in leadership will shake off the [aura of shadiness](https://9now.nine.com.au/a-current-affair/asic-confirms-investigation-amid-company-trading-halt-over-agricultural-deal-links/867b1215-8fcc-4348-a222-7efc53b24f6c). Although, it is not as wholesale as some may like:

> Former DomaCom [Chair] Grahame Evans remains on the Board as non-executive Deputy Chairman ...

A Chair that governed a company into a perpetual 10-month-long ASX suspension gets to keep his seat on the board? 

Must be nice being a rich-old-white-man.
