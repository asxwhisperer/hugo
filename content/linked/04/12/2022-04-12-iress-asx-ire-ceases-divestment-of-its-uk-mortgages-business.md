Financial software services company, [Iress (ASX:IRE)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/IRE):

> has decided not to proceed with the divestment of its UK Mortgages business.

Originally announced on [11 June 2021](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02383851-3A568733?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4).

The UK Mortgages business currently: 

> contribut[es] £16.1m of revenue and £6.4m of NPAT

 Why?
 
 > During the sale process, global market volatility increased and technology company valuations declined. It became evident that purchasers' valuations were likely to be below levels that represent a reasonable return to Iress' shareholders.
