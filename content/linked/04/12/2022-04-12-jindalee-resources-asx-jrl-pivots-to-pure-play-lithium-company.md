Resources exploration company, [Jindalee Resources (ASX:JRL)](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/JRL):

> proposes to seperate the Company's Australian assets into a stand-alone vehicle, NewCo, which will be listed on ASX in order to reposition Jindalee as a pure-play, US lithium developer.

Is pure-play lithium developer the new meme stock? Capturing the Tesla fanboys?
